### Final Diagnosis:

After reviewing the medical reports from the Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist, our multidisciplinary team has identified the following 3 possible health issues of the patient:

* **Anxiety Disorder with Panic Attacks**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath are consistent with panic attacks, and their history of anxiety diagnosis and current symptoms suggest a possible exacerbation of anxiety symptoms. (Reason: Consistent symptoms across all three reports, including cardiologist's report of anxiety-related symptoms, psychologist's report of anxiety disorder, and pulmonologist's report of anxiety-related hyperventilation.)
* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath may be related to GERD, which can cause respiratory symptoms and exacerbate anxiety. (Reason: Cardiologist's report of GERD-related symptoms, pulmonologist's report of GERD as a potential contributor to respiratory symptoms, and potential impact on anxiety symptoms.)
* **Undiagnosed Cardiac Condition**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath may be related to an underlying cardiac condition, such as Cardiac Syndrome X or premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). (Reason: Cardiologist's report of possible cardiac causes, including Cardiac Syndrome X and PVCs, and need for further evaluation with stress test, event monitor, and cardiac MRI or CT angiogram.)
