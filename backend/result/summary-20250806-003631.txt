After reviewing the medical reports from the Cardiologist, Psychologist, and Pulmonologist, our multidisciplinary team has identified the following 3 possible health issues of the patient:

* **Anxiety Disorder with Panic Attacks**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, heart palpitations, and shortness of breath are consistent with panic attacks, and their history of anxiety diagnosis and current symptoms suggest an exacerbation of anxiety symptoms. (Reason: Consistent symptoms across all three reports, including anxiety-related symptoms, fear of having a heart attack, and feeling of impending doom.)
* **Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD)**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath may be related to GERD, which can cause respiratory symptoms and exacerbate anxiety. (Reason: GERD-related symptoms mentioned in the Cardiologist and Pulmonologist reports, and potential contribution to anxiety symptoms.)
* **Undiagnosed Cardiac Condition (e.g., Cardiac Syndrome X or Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs))**: The patient's symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath may be related to an underlying cardiac condition, such as Cardiac Syndrome X or PVCs, which require further evaluation and testing to rule out. (Reason: Cardiologist report mentions possible cardiac causes, including Cardiac Syndrome X and PVCs, and recommended further testing to rule out underlying cardiac conditions.)
